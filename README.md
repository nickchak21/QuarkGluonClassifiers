# QuarkGluonClassifiers
This repo contains notebooks that will run the different types of quark/gluon classifiers, all optimized and trained to convergence.

To run, you will want to use a GPU. I recommend CoLab. To open these notebooks, go to https://colab.research.google.com/ and click on Github. Type "nickchak21" into the Github URL space, and select the nickchak21/QuarkGluonClassifiers repository. You will then see a list of notebooks, and you can choose the one you wish to run.
